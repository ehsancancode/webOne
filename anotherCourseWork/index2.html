        <h2>About Our Project</h2>
        <p>
            Team Innovators is developing a lightweight monitoring system called
            <b>Smart Freezer Alerts</b>, designed for small kiosk and shop owners who need
            to keep track of freezer temperatures. Even short temperature rises can
            lead to food spoilage and financial loss, so our system provides quick
            alerts, a simple status dashboard, and basic sensor health monitoring.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal is to help owners react before problems become costly. By focusing
            on reliability and ease of use, Smart Freezer Alerts gives small businesses
            an accessible way to monitor their equipment without needing complicated
            tools or technical knowledge.
