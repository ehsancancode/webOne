        <h2>About Our Project</h2>
        <p>
            Team Innovators is developing a collaborative web platform designed to help students work together more effectively on personal and group projects.
            Our goal is to bring everything a student team needs into one place — from creating groups and sharing ideas to managing tasks and holding online meetings.
            Inspired by our motto, <i>“Think. Build. Grow.”</i>, our system encourages students to brainstorm ideas, turn them into real projects, and continue improving them over time.
            Whether it’s for classwork or personal goals, our platform aims to make teamwork easier, smarter, and more connected.
