## Communication Strategy

### Manage Closely (High Power / High Interest)
Kiosk owners and operations managers get a short weekly update with a demo clip and notes on any alert logic changes. If alert delays or temperature issues appear, we contact them immediately and share risk deltas.

### Keep Satisfied (High Power / Low Interest)
Security lead receives a monthly summary covering authentication status, rate limits, and any unusual login patterns. Real-time escalation only happens if repeated login failures occur.

### Keep Informed (Low Power / High Interest)
QA (Igor) and regulators receive test notes, defect summaries, and verification updates after each sprint. They can review dashboard builds and alert history samples anytime.

### Monitor (Low Power / Low Interest)
Cloud provider and SMS/email provider are monitored passively through their public status pages. We only contact them if error rates or delays show up in system logs.
