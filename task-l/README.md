This folder contains my final, improved 3-page website for Task L. I collected my pages from Tasks I, J, and K and refined them into one consistent and 
professional site based on teacher feedback and my own observations.

What I Improved (based on feedback + self-review)

1. Unified Layout & Navigation:

    Same navbar on all three pages.
    
    Active page highlighting.
    
    Mobile hamburger menu added.
    
    Consistent spacing, fonts, and colors across the site

2. Visual Design Improvements:

    Increased text sizes for readability on large screens
    
    Improved button styles and spacing.
    
    Added fade-in animations for a modern look.
    
    Updated hero section and content alignment.

3. Catalog Page Changes:

    Re-styled all apartment cards.
    
    Improved grid layout and spacing.
    
    Added required example.jpg image.
    
    Standardized titles, descriptions, and pricing.

4. Order Form Improvements:

    Redesigned the form to be narrower and more readable.
    
    Organized fields using fieldsets and a two-column date layout.
    
    Enlarged date picker and input fields.
    
    Fixed checkbox alignment.
    
    Centered the form header.

    Added clearer labels and improved validation.

5. Code Quality & Accessibility:

    Improved semantic structure (header, nav, main, section, footer).
    
    Added descriptive alt text for images.
    
    Ensured consistent use of containers and spacing.
